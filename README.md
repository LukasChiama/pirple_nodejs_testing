This repo contains code that that runs Node.js tests on functions and outputs the results of the tests.

There are five different functions defined in the app directory. These functions do different things and are tested by tests written in the test.js file of the test folder.

One of the tests is designed to fail so an error report will be printed for the user. The four other tests pass.
